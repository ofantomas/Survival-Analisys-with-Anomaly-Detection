# Survival analysis with Anomaly Detection

Survival analysis is a well studied area of statistics which helps us predict lifespans of individuals from a certain population. 
Proposed method tries to account for the past history of an individual in order to improve interpretability and quality of predictions.

Proposed method relies on anomaly detection to account for events which could lead to decrease in survival chances in the future. Proposed model for anomaly detection is an Attention UNET adapted for timeseries prediction. 

Repo consists of notebooks with all the experiments, as well as modules, containing the code.
